## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06740) 

## Purpose of the project
This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as part of the publication
[MultiADS: Defect-aware Supervision for Multi-type Anomaly Detection and Segmentation in Zero-Shot Learning]
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06740) which has been accepted by **ICCV 2025**.

## Introduction
![alt text](images/architecture.png)
We present MultiADS, the first framework that goes beyond binary “good/bad” inspection to detect,
localize, and label multiple defect types simultaneously.
